> I want to write a program that can help me achive the following: I want to fetch data from GitHub Actions and plot the length of a run for a workflow. It should be configurable which project, and workflow it should take from GitHub and we should create a interactive website where the user can see the plot. Suggest an architecture and programming languages we should do to achive this. If you have any questions let me know and I will answer them.
> 

GitHub:

> Here's a high-level architecture and technology stack suggestion for your project:
> 
> 1. **Frontend**: JavaScript with React.js for building the interactive website. You can use a library like Chart.js or D3.js for creating the plots.
> 2. **Backend**: Node.js with Express.js for creating the server-side application. This will handle requests from the frontend, fetch data from GitHub Actions API, and send the data back to the frontend.
> 3. **GitHub Actions API**: You will use this to fetch data about the workflows. You will need to authenticate with GitHub, which can be done using OAuth.
> 4. **Database**: MongoDB or PostgreSQL for storing fetched data from GitHub Actions. This is optional and depends on whether you want to store the data or fetch it in real-time.
> 5. **Deployment**: You can use services like AWS, Google Cloud, or Heroku for deploying your application.
> 
> Here's a rough architecture:
> 
> 1. The user interacts with the React.js frontend, selecting a project and workflow.
> 2. The frontend sends a request to the Express.js backend with the selected project and workflow.
> 3. The backend authenticates with GitHub (if not already authenticated) and sends a request to the GitHub Actions API for the selected project and workflow.
> 4. The GitHub Actions API responds with the data, which the backend then processes.
> 5. If you're using a database, the backend stores the data in the database.
> 6. The backend sends the processed data back to the frontend.
> 7. The frontend uses Chart.js or D3.js to plot the data.
> 
> Remember to handle errors and edge cases, such as what happens if the GitHub Actions API is down or if the user selects a project or workflow that doesn't exist.
> 

Me: 

> Ok lets start help me in writing the backend as you proposed. Lets leave out the database stuff for now we can add that later. What do I have to do? Give me exact files and installations in my terminal do proceed with the backend.
> 

GitHub:

> Sure, let's start by setting up a new Node.js project with Express.js. Here are the steps:
> 
> 1. **Initialize a new Node.js project**: Open your terminal and navigate to the directory where you want to create your project. Then run the following command to create a new Node.js project:
> 
> ```bash
> npm init -y
> 
> ```
> 
> This will create a new `package.json` file in your directory.
> 
> 1. **Install Express.js**: Next, install Express.js, which is a web application framework for Node.js. Run the following command in your terminal:
> 
> ```bash
> npm install express
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Install Axios**: Axios is a promise-based HTTP client for the browser and Node.js. We will use it to make requests to the GitHub Actions API. Run the following command in your terminal:
> 
> ```bash
> npm install axios
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Create a new file for your Express.js application**: Create a new file in your project directory named `app.js` (or whatever you prefer). This file will contain your Express.js application.
> 2. **Set up your Express.js application**: Open `app.js` in your text editor and add the following code to set up a basic Express.js application:
> 
> ```jsx
> const express = require('express');
> const axios = require('axios');
> const app = express();
> const port = 3000;
> 
> app.get('/', (req, res) => {
>   res.send('Hello World!');
> });
> 
> app.listen(port, () => {
>   console.log(`App listening at <http://localhost>:${port}`);
> });
> 
> ```
> 
> This code creates a new Express.js application and sets it up to listen on port 3000. When you navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser, you should see the message "Hello World!".
> 
> 1. **Run your Express.js application**: You can start your Express.js application by running the following command in your terminal:
> 
> ```bash
> node app.js
> 
> ```
> 
> In the next steps, we will add the functionality to fetch data from the GitHub Actions API.
> 

Me:

> Ok lets now fetch some data from the GiHub Actions API. For that we need to authenticate to Github. How can we achive this without hardcoding any credentials in the code? And then from outside the user of the backend should be able to specify the repository and the workflow to get data.
> 

GitHub

> To authenticate with GitHub without hardcoding credentials, you can use environment variables. You'll need a GitHub token, which you can generate in your GitHub account settings under Developer settings > Personal access tokens.
> 
> 
> Once you have the token, you can set it as an environment variable in your development environment. If you're using a Unix-based system like Linux or MacOS, you can set environment variables in your terminal like this:
> 
> ```bash
> export GITHUB_TOKEN=your_token_here
> 
> ```
> 
> In your Node.js application, you can access this environment variable with `process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN`.
> 
> To allow the user to specify the repository and workflow, you can use URL parameters in Express.js. Here's an example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```jsx
> app.get('/workflow/:owner/:repo/:workflow', async (req, res) => {
>   const { owner, repo, workflow } = req.params;
> 
>   try {
>     const response = await axios.get(`https://api.github.com/repos/${owner}/${repo}/actions/workflows/${workflow}/runs`, {
>       headers: {
>         Authorization: `token ${process.env.GITHUB_TOKEN}`
>       }
>     });
> 
>     res.json(response.data);
>   } catch (error) {
>     res.json({ error: error.message });
>   }
> });
> 
> ```
> 

Me

> How can I test that?
> 

Github:

> You can test your new endpoint using a tool like curl, Postman, or simply by entering the URL in your web browser.
> 
> 
> Here's how you can do it with curl:
> 
> ```bash
> curl <http://localhost:3000/workflow/{owner}/{repo}/{workflow}>
> 
> ```
> 
> Replace `{owner}`, `{repo}`, and `{workflow}` with the actual values. For example, if you want to fetch workflow runs for the `actions/checkout` workflow in the `actions` repository owned by `actions`, you would do:
> 
> ```bash
> curl <http://localhost:3000/workflow/actions/actions/checkout>
> 
> ```
> 
> Remember to start your Express.js application before testing the endpoint. You can do this by running `node app.js` in your terminal.
> 
> If everything is set up correctly, you should see a JSON response with data about the workflow runs. If there's an error, you'll see a JSON response with an error message.
> 

Me

> Ok now lets build the frontend which fetches the data from the backend and then displays over the time axis the run time so that the user can see how the runtime varies from run to run. Additionally the user interface should provide the ability with textfield to give a owner repo and workflow. Please use the architecture for the frontend you proposed in the beginning.
> 

GitHub

> Sure, let's create a React application that fetches data from your backend and displays it in a chart. We'll use Create React App to bootstrap the project and Chart.js for the chart.
> 
> 1. **Create a new React application**: Open a new terminal window and navigate to the directory where you want to create your frontend. Then run the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> npx create-react-app github-actions-visualizer
> 
> ```
> 
> This will create a new directory named `github-actions-visualizer` with a new React application.
> 
> 1. **Install Chart.js**: Navigate into your new React application directory and install Chart.js:
> 
> ```bash
> cd github-actions-visualizer
> npm install react-chartjs-2 chart.js
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Create a new component for your chart**: Create a new file in the `src` directory named `WorkflowChart.js`. This component will fetch data from your backend and display it in a chart. Here's a basic example of how you can do this:
> 
> ```jsx
> import React, { useEffect, useState } from 'react';
> import { Line } from 'react-chartjs-2';
> import axios from 'axios';
> 
> function WorkflowChart({ owner, repo, workflow }) {
>   const [data, setData] = useState([]);
> 
>   useEffect(() => {
>     const fetchData = async () => {
>       try {
>         const response = await axios.get(`http://localhost:3000/workflow/${owner}/${repo}/${workflow}`);
>         setData(response.data.workflow_runs.map(run => ({ x: run.created_at, y: run.run_duration_ms })));
>       } catch (error) {
>         console.error(error);
>       }
>     };
> 
>     fetchData();
>   }, [owner, repo, workflow]);
> 
>   return (
>     <Line data={{ datasets: [{ data, fill: false, borderColor: 'rgb(75, 192, 192)' }] }} options={{ scales: { x: { type: 'time', time: { unit: 'minute' } } } }} />
>   );
> }
> 
> export default WorkflowChart;
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Create a new component for your form**: Create a new file in the `src` directory named `WorkflowForm.js`. This component will contain the form for the user to enter the owner, repo, and workflow. Here's a basic example:
> 
> ```jsx
> import React, { useState } from 'react';
> 
> function WorkflowForm({ onSubmit }) {
>   const [owner, setOwner] = useState('');
>   const [repo, setRepo] = useState('');
>   const [workflow, setWorkflow] = useState('');
> 
>   const handleSubmit = (event) => {
>     event.preventDefault();
>     onSubmit({ owner, repo, workflow });
>   };
> 
>   return (
>     <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
>       <input type="text" value={owner} onChange={e => setOwner(e.target.value)} placeholder="Owner" required />
>       <input type="text" value={repo} onChange={e => setRepo(e.target.value)} placeholder="Repo" required />
>       <input type="text" value={workflow} onChange={e => setWorkflow(e.target.value)} placeholder="Workflow" required />
>       <button type="submit">Submit</button>
>     </form>
>   );
> }
> 
> export default WorkflowForm;
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Update your App component**: Open `src/App.js` and update it to use your new components:
> 
> ```jsx
> import React, { useState } from 'react';
> import WorkflowForm from './WorkflowForm';
> import WorkflowChart from './WorkflowChart';
> 
> function App() {
>   const [workflowData, setWorkflowData] = useState(null);
> 
>   const handleSubmit = (data) => {
>     setWorkflowData(data);
>   };
> 
>   return (
>     <div className="App">
>       <WorkflowForm onSubmit={handleSubmit} />
>       {workflowData && <WorkflowChart {...workflowData} />}
>     </div>
>   );
> }
> 
> export default App;
> 
> ```
> 
> 1. **Start your React application**: You can start your React application by running the following command in your terminal:
> 
> ```bash
> npm start
> 
> ```
> 
> Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:3000` in your web browser, you should see a form where you can enter the owner, repo, and workflow. After submitting the form, you should see a chart with the run durations for the specified workflow.

Me

> My backend is already running at port 3000 do I have to change that my React application is running at a different port?
> 

GitHub

> Yes, you can change the port your React application runs on by setting the `PORT` environment variable. Here's how you can do it:
> 
> 1. **Unix-based systems (Linux, MacOS)**: Open a new terminal window and navigate to your React application directory. Then run the following command:
> 
> ```bash
> PORT=3001 npm start
> 
> ```
> 
> This will start your React application on port 3001.
> 
> 1. **Windows**: If you're using Windows, the command is slightly different. Open a new command prompt window and navigate to your React application directory. Then run the following command:
> 
> ```
> set PORT=3001 && npm start
> 
> ```
> 
> This will also start your React application on port 3001.
> 
> Now, if you navigate to `http://localhost:3001` in your web browser, you should see your React application. Your backend should still be running on `http://localhost:3000`.

Copilot

> The error you're seeing is due to the browser's same-origin policy, which restricts how a document or script loaded from one origin can interact with a resource from another origin. To fix this, you can use the `cors` middleware in your Express app.

> First, install the `cors` package:

> ok it works but it does not show me what I want in my frontend application. I want to have a graph where on the x axis I see each run with a link to that github action run and on the y axis how long it took in minutes. With that I should be able to detect if action runs take always the same length, vary often or if we added a regression

GitHub

GitHub
