> @workspace Write a detailed [README.md](http://readme.md/) file to document the code in the current repository. Summarize what the repository is meant to accomplish. Explain the key files, functions, classes, and features. Use Markdown formatting for headings, code blocks, lists, etc. to make it organized and readable. Use mermaid.js for any diagrams, architecture, workflows to make it easier to understand the bigger picture. Aim for a beginner-friendly explanation that gives a developer unfamiliar with the code a good starting point to understand it. Ensure to include: - Overview of directory purpose - Functionality explanations - Relevant diagrams or visuals if helpful. Write the README content clearly and concisely using complete sentences and paragraphs based on the shared context. Use proper spelling, grammar, and punctuation throughout. Enclose your full README text with triple backticks using markdown format inside one single code block, and use HTML entities for any backticks inside the code block. Do not make assumptions or fabricate additional details.

> # GitHub Actions Visualizer
> 
> This repository is designed to visualize GitHub Actions workflows. It fetches data from the GitHub Actions API and displays it in a line chart. The main components of this repository are the `app.js` file, which serves as the backend server, and the `github-actions-visualizer` directory, which contains the frontend React application.
> 
> ## Directory Structure
> 
> - `app.js`: This is the main server file. It defines two endpoints: one for the root URL and one for fetching workflow data.
> - `github-actions-visualizer`: This directory contains the frontend React application. Key files include:
>   - `App.js`: This is the main React component. It renders the `WorkflowForm` and `WorkflowChart` components.
>   - `WorkflowForm.js`: This component allows the user to input the owner, repo, and workflow ID.
>   - `WorkflowChart.js`: This component fetches the workflow data from the server and displays it in a line chart.
> 
> ## Functionality
> 
> The `app.js` file defines a GET endpoint at `/workflow/:owner/:repo/:workflow`. This endpoint fetches workflow data from the GitHub Actions API using the provided owner, repo, and workflow ID. It uses the `axios` library to send the API request and the `GITHUB_TOKEN` environment variable for authentication.
> 
> The `WorkflowForm` component in `WorkflowForm.js` is a simple form that takes the owner, repo, and workflow ID as input. When the form is submitted, it calls the `onSubmit` prop with the input values.
> 
> The `WorkflowChart` component in `WorkflowChart.js` fetches the workflow data from the server when it receives new props. It uses the `axios` library to send the GET request and the `recharts` library to display the data in a line chart.
> 
> ```javascript
> app.get('/workflow/:owner/:repo/:workflow', async (req, res) => {
>   const { owner, repo, workflow } = req.params;
>   // ...
> });
> 
> ```
> 
> ## Diagram
> 
> ```mermaid
> graph TD;
>     A[WorkflowForm Component] --> B[Submit];
>     B --> C[App Component];
>     C --> D[WorkflowChart Component];
>     D --> E[axios GET request];
>     E --> F[Server];

> 
> This diagram represents the flow of data in the application. The user inputs the owner, repo, and workflow ID in the `WorkflowForm` component. When the form is submitted, the `App` component updates the props of the `WorkflowChart` component, which fetches the workflow data from the server and displays it in a line chart.
